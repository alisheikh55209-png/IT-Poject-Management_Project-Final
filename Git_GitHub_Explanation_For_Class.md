## 📚 Git & GitHub Concepts We Used

### 1. **Repository (Repo)**
- Think of it as a "project folder" stored online
- Contains all our code, files, and project history
- Link: https://github.com/alisheikh55209-png/IT-Poject-Management_Project-Final

### 2. **Branches**
- Like separate "workspaces" for each team member
- Everyone works on their own branch without affecting others
- Main branch = final/stable code
- Feature branches = individual work areas

### 3. **Commits**
- "Save points" in your work
- Each commit has a message explaining what changed
- Like taking snapshots of your progress

### 4. **Pull Requests (PRs)**
- Way to ask "Can I merge my work into the main project?"
- Team lead reviews and approves changes
- Prevents conflicts and maintains code quality

### 5. **Merge**
- Combining different branches together
- Taking individual work and adding it to main project

## 🔄 Our Workflow Process

```
1. Clone Repository → 2. Create Branch → 3. Make Changes → 4. Commit → 5. Push → 6. Pull Request → 7. Review → 8. Merge
```

### Step-by-Step:
1. **Clone:** Download project to local computer
2. **Branch:** Create personal workspace (`feature-ali`, `feature-muneeb`, `feature-faraz`)
3. **Code:** Work on assigned sections
4. **Commit:** Save progress with descriptive messages
5. **Push:** Upload changes to GitHub
6. **PR:** Request to merge work into main project
7. **Review:** Team lead checks code quality
8. **Merge:** Approved changes added to main project
